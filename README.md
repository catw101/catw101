## Hi, I'm Catelen! 👋
I'm a senior studying CS at Columbia University. Outside of academics, I am also a part of the <a href="http://gwcatcolumbia.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> club on campus.

🌱 I am interested in full stack development and data science.  
🔭 I previously interned at Bank of America, Chipper Cash, and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
