## Hi, I'm Catelen! ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a sophomore studying CS and Applied Math at Columbia University. Outside of academics, I am also a part of the <a href="http://gwcatcolumbia.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> club on campus.

ðŸŒ± I am interested in full stack development, app development, data science, and cybersecurity.  
ðŸ““ This semester, I am taking the following courses: Open Source Development, CS Theory, and Fundamentals of Computer Systems.   
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/catw101/Recipe-Extraction">recipe ingredient extractor for faster online grocery shopping</a>.
